# Quickstart

Get relay running and create your first WhatsApp conversation.

## 1. Connect WhatsApp

Authenticate with WhatsApp by scanning a QR code:

```bash
relay whatsapp login
```

A QR code appears in your terminal. Scan it with your WhatsApp app. Auth state is saved locally in `.relay-agent/whatsapp-auth/` and reconnects automatically on restart.

You can verify the connection at any time:

```bash
relay whatsapp status
```

## 2. Start the Daemon

Launch the persistent background process:

```bash
relay start
```

The daemon runs on `localhost:3214` and maintains the WhatsApp connection. All CLI commands communicate with the daemon via HTTP.

## 3. Configure API Credentials

Set up the model provider for agent sessions:

```bash
relay init --api-key sk-ant-... --provider anthropic
```

You can also use `--provider openai` with an OpenAI key. If you omit the flags, the command prompts interactively. Alternatively, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 4. Create a Conversation

Create a new conversation instance with an objective and todo list:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time for order #4421" \
  --todos="ask preferred time,confirm address,get signature name" \
  --heartbeat-interval=1800000 \
  --max-followups=5
```

Returns a unique instance ID. The agent sends an initial message via WhatsApp and the conversation begins.

## 5. Monitor Progress

Check the state of your conversation:

```bash
relay get <instance-id>
```

List all active instances:

```bash
relay list
```

Read the full transcript:

```bash
relay transcript <instance-id>
```

## 6. Control the Conversation

Pause, resume, or cancel at any time:

```bash
relay pause <instance-id>
relay resume <instance-id>
relay cancel <instance-id>
```

Inject a message manually when needed:

```bash
relay send <instance-id> "Sorry for the delay, checking now"
```

## 7. Stop the Daemon

When you're done:

```bash
relay stop
```

All state is flushed to disk and persists for the next session.
