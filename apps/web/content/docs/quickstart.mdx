# Quickstart

Get relay running in your agent workflow.

## Start an Interview

Trigger a conversation with a specific user:

```bash
relay interview start \
  --user-id=usr_8123 \
  --objective="validate onboarding friction"
```

relay will:
- Introduce the purpose of the conversation
- Validate consent
- Ask structured questions based on the objective
- Follow up on areas of friction
- Confirm a summary with the user
- Close respectfully

## Start a Group Interview

Coordinate conversations across multiple users with shared context:

```bash
relay group-interview start \
  --group-id=power_users \
  --shared-context=product_feedback
```

## Pull Results

Retrieve structured results from any conversation:

```bash
relay pull --conversation-id=cnv_4421
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "summary": "...",
  "structured_data": {},
  "confidence": 0.82,
  "raw_log_url": "..."
}
```

## View Logs

Every external interaction is traceable:

```bash
relay logs --conversation-id=cnv_4421
```

> **Preview**: This documents the intended CLI interface. relay is under active development.
