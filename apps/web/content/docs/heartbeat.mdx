# Heartbeat System

The heartbeat system automatically re-engages contacts who have not responded within a configurable time interval.

## How It Works

When a conversation enters `WAITING_FOR_REPLY` and the contact does not respond within the configured heartbeat interval, the system:

1. Transitions the instance to `HEARTBEAT_SCHEDULED`
2. The agent composes and sends a follow-up message
3. The instance transitions back to `WAITING_FOR_REPLY`
4. The cycle repeats until the contact responds or max follow-ups are reached

## Configuration

Set heartbeat parameters when creating a conversation:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery" \
  --heartbeat=30m \
  --max-followups=5
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `--heartbeat` | 30m | Time to wait before sending a follow-up |
| `--max-followups` | 5 | Maximum number of follow-up attempts |

## Behavior

- **Timer accuracy**: within 30 seconds of the scheduled time
- **Follow-up content**: the agent decides the follow-up message based on conversation context and objective
- **Abandonment**: when max follow-ups are reached and the contact still has not responded, the instance transitions to `ABANDONED`
- **Pausing**: when an instance is paused, heartbeat timers are suspended. They resume when the instance is resumed.

## Monitoring

Check heartbeat state for an instance:

```bash
relay get cnv_7f3a
```

Output includes:
- Current follow-up count (e.g., `2/5`)
- Time until next heartbeat
- Whether heartbeats are active or suspended
