# Introduction

relay is a restricted external agent that isolates execution power from communication power.

## The Problem

Your core agent has filesystem access, code execution, internal APIs, and secrets. When it needs to talk to real humans — via WhatsApp, voice calls, interviews, or outreach — you don't want that same powerful agent exposed externally.

You want **communication without capability leakage**.

## The Solution

relay is a separate agent that can only talk. It handles structured conversations, interviews, and multi-channel outreach while your core agent retains full system access.

**relay can:**
- Have structured conversations
- Run interviews (individual or group)
- Call users via voice (ElevenLabs)
- Message via WhatsApp
- Maintain scoped conversation memory

**relay cannot:**
- Execute arbitrary code
- Access your filesystem
- Use developer tools
- Call internal APIs directly
- Escalate privileges

## Product Principles

1. **Capability Isolation** — Two agents: Core Agent (full access) + Relay Agent (conversation-only). No shared execution context.

2. **API-First** — Everything is programmable. No UI dependency. No hidden flows.

3. **Conversation as Execution Boundary** — relay collects information, follows an internal checklist, and produces structured output. The core agent decides what to do with that output.
