# Security Model

relay enforces strict capability isolation between your core agent and external communication.

## Hard Constraints

relay **cannot**:

- Read your files
- Execute code
- Call internal APIs
- Escalate roles
- Modify infrastructure

It **only**:

- Talks
- Collects
- Summarizes
- Reports

## Structured Data Bridge

Your core agent communicates with relay via a strict schema. No arbitrary instructions. No tool injection.

```json
{
  "objective": "string",
  "constraints": [],
  "allowed_updates": ["shared_context"]
}
```

The core agent defines the objective and constraints. relay operates within those bounds and returns structured output.

## Channels

### WhatsApp
- Conversational interviews
- Async follow-ups
- User validation
- Customer research

### Voice (via ElevenLabs)
- Outbound interviews
- Qualification calls
- Onboarding assistance
- Research calls

Voice is conversational only. No execution layer.

## Design Principle

> Your core agent stays powerful. relay stays contained. Separation by design.
