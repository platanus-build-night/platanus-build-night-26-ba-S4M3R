# Quickstart

Get relay running and create your first WhatsApp conversation.

## 1. Initialize

Set up WhatsApp authentication by scanning the QR code:

```bash
relay init
```

This displays a QR code in your terminal. Scan it with WhatsApp to authenticate. Auth state persists in `.relay-agent/` and reconnects automatically on restart.

## 2. Start the Daemon

Launch the persistent background process:

```bash
relay start
```

The daemon runs on `localhost:3214` and maintains the WhatsApp connection. All CLI commands communicate with the daemon via HTTP.

## 3. Create a Conversation

Create a new conversation instance with an objective and optional todo list:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time for order #4421" \
  --todo="ask preferred time,confirm address,get signature name" \
  --heartbeat=30m \
  --max-followups=5
```

Returns a unique instance ID (e.g., `cnv_7f3a`). The agent sends an initial message via WhatsApp and the conversation begins.

## 4. Monitor Progress

Check the state of your conversation:

```bash
relay get cnv_7f3a
```

List all active instances:

```bash
relay list
```

Read the full transcript:

```bash
relay transcript cnv_7f3a
```

## 5. Control the Conversation

Pause, resume, or cancel at any time:

```bash
relay pause cnv_7f3a
relay resume cnv_7f3a
relay cancel cnv_7f3a
```

Inject a message manually when needed:

```bash
relay send cnv_7f3a "Sorry for the delay, checking now"
```

## 6. Stop the Daemon

When you're done:

```bash
relay stop
```

All state is flushed to disk and persists for the next session.

> **Note**: relay is under active development. This documents the intended CLI interface.
