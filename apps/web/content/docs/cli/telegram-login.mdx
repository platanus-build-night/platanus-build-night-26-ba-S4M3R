# relay telegram login

Connect a Telegram bot by providing a bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather). The token is verified against the Telegram API before being saved.

```bash
relay telegram login --token <BOT_TOKEN>
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `--token <token>` | Yes | Telegram bot token from @BotFather |

## Output

On success, displays the bot's username and name, then saves the token locally.

```
Bot verified successfully!
  Username: @my_relay_bot
  Name:     My Relay Bot

Token saved. The daemon will use this on next start.
```

## Notes

- The token is saved in `.relay-agent/telegram-auth/token.json` and persists across daemon restarts.
- The daemon automatically reconnects to Telegram on startup if a saved token exists.
- Users must message the bot on Telegram before relay can send them messages.
