# Security Model

relay enforces strict capability isolation between your main agent and external communication.

## Hard Constraints

The conversation agent within each instance has **no access** to:

- Filesystem (read or write)
- Code execution
- Internal APIs
- Web browsing or network access beyond WhatsApp
- Role escalation or privilege modification
- Infrastructure modification

It **only**:

- Sends messages via WhatsApp
- Tracks todo item completion
- Manages conversation lifecycle
- Schedules heartbeat follow-ups
- Flags conversations for human intervention

## Conversation-Scoped Tools

Each conversation instance runs an isolated agent session with exactly five tools:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `send_message(text)` | Deliver a message via WhatsApp |
| `mark_todo_item(todo_id, status)` | Track checklist progress (`pending`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `skipped`) |
| `end_conversation(reason)` | Close the conversation as completed |
| `request_human_intervention(reason)` | Flag the conversation for human review, transitions to `NEEDS_HUMAN_INTERVENTION` |
| `schedule_next_heartbeat(delay_ms)` | Override the delay before the next follow-up timer |

No tool injection. No arbitrary instructions. No escape from this scope.

> **Note**: A `place_call` tool is defined as a stub for future voice call support. It always returns a "not available" response in v1.

## Network Boundary

relay exposes exactly two network listeners:

1. **WhatsApp WebSocket** — Baileys v7 connection to WhatsApp servers
2. **HTTP IPC on localhost:3214** — Bound to loopback interface only. CLI commands communicate with the daemon via this local server.

No external HTTP listeners. No webhooks (v1). No cloud connectivity.

## Data Isolation

- All external input (WhatsApp messages from contacts) is isolated within the conversation instance
- Contact messages are never exposed to the main agent's execution context
- WhatsApp auth credentials are stored locally in `.relay-agent/whatsapp-auth/` with filesystem-level permissions
- All state persists as JSON files via lowdb

## Design Principle

> Your main agent stays powerful. relay stays contained. Separation by design.
