# Quickstart

Get relay running and create your first conversation — via WhatsApp, Telegram, or phone call.

## 1. Connect WhatsApp

Authenticate with WhatsApp by scanning a QR code:

```bash
relay whatsapp login
```

A QR code appears in your terminal. Scan it with your WhatsApp app. Auth state is saved locally in `.relay-agent/whatsapp-auth/` and reconnects automatically on restart.

You can verify the connection at any time:

```bash
relay whatsapp status
```

## 2. Start the Daemon

Launch the persistent background process:

```bash
relay start
```

The daemon runs on `localhost:3214` and maintains channel connections (WhatsApp, Telegram, phone). All CLI commands communicate with the daemon via HTTP.

## 3. Configure API Credentials

Set up the model provider for agent sessions:

```bash
relay init --api-key sk-ant-... --provider anthropic
```

You can also use `--provider openai` with an OpenAI key. If you omit the flags, the command prompts interactively. Alternatively, set the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

## 4. Create a Conversation

Create a new conversation instance with an objective and todo list:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time for order #4421" \
  --todos="ask preferred time,confirm address,get signature name" \
  --heartbeat-interval=1800000 \
  --max-followups=5
```

Returns a unique instance ID. The agent sends an initial message via WhatsApp and the conversation begins.

## 5. Monitor Progress

Check the state of your conversation:

```bash
relay get <instance-id>
```

List all active instances:

```bash
relay list
```

Read the full transcript:

```bash
relay transcript <instance-id>
```

## 6. Control the Conversation

Pause, resume, or cancel at any time:

```bash
relay pause <instance-id>
relay resume <instance-id>
relay cancel <instance-id>
```

Inject a message manually when needed:

```bash
relay send <instance-id> "Sorry for the delay, checking now"
```

## 7. Stop the Daemon

When you're done:

```bash
relay stop
```

All state is flushed to disk and persists for the next session.

## Telegram

relay supports Telegram as a conversation channel via a bot powered by the [grammY](https://grammy.dev) framework.

### Prerequisites

- A Telegram bot token from [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)

### Connect the bot

```bash
relay telegram login --token <BOT_TOKEN>
```

The token is verified against the Telegram API and saved locally in `.relay-agent/telegram-auth/`. The daemon auto-reconnects on restart.

Check the bot status at any time:

```bash
relay telegram status
```

### Create a Telegram conversation

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time for order #4421" \
  --todos="ask preferred time,confirm address" \
  --channel=telegram
```

The contact must message the bot on Telegram to start receiving replies. When the user sends a message, relay maps their chat ID to the instance and routes replies through the bot.

You can also provide a known chat ID directly:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time" \
  --todos="ask ETA,confirm address" \
  --channel=telegram \
  --telegram-chat-id=123456789
```

### Disconnect

```bash
relay telegram logout
```

## Phone Calls (ElevenLabs)

relay also supports outbound phone calls via ElevenLabs Conversational AI. Calls use Twilio for telephony and ElevenLabs for the voice agent.

### Prerequisites

- An [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) account with Conversational AI enabled
- A Twilio phone number connected to your ElevenLabs account
- Set your API key:

```bash
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

### Quick call (standalone)

Place a one-off call without instance tracking:

```bash
relay call "+56912345678" \
  --phone-number-id=PN123abc \
  --prompt="Confirm the delivery window for order #4421" \
  --first-message="Hi, I'm calling from Acme Co about your delivery."
```

### Managed call (with instance tracking)

Create a full conversation instance on the phone channel — with objectives, todos, and transcript storage:

```bash
relay create \
  --contact="+56912345678" \
  --objective="confirm delivery time for order #4421" \
  --todos="ask preferred time,confirm address" \
  --channel=phone \
  --phone-number-id=PN123abc \
  --first-message="Hi, I'm calling about your recent order."
```

The daemon polls ElevenLabs for call status. When the call ends, the transcript is stored and the instance transitions to `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`.
