# relay whatsapp login

Connect WhatsApp by scanning a QR code. Runs in the foreground (not through the daemon) so you can see the QR code in your terminal.

```bash
relay whatsapp login
relay whatsapp login --browser
```

## Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--browser` | Render the QR code in the browser instead of the terminal |

- Displays a QR code — scan it with your WhatsApp app
- Auth state is saved to `.relay-agent/whatsapp-auth/`
- Times out after 2 minutes if no scan
- Automatically retries once if a stale session is detected

After successful login, run `relay start` to launch the daemon with the saved credentials.
